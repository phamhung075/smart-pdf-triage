# 👥 Agent Roster

Every agent is defined **twice**:

1. A minimal shell in `.claude/agents/<name>.md` — frontmatter with `name` + `description` only, body linking here. Claude Code reads these to pick which agent to spawn.
2. A full playbook in `docs/agents/<name>.md` — read on first invocation. Encodes triggers, must-read links, forbidden actions, done-when checklist.

This split keeps `.claude/agents/` small (fast to load, easy to browse) and makes the docs a single source of truth (easy to edit, git-diff-friendly).

## Skills ↔ team

Every agent layers methodology skills on top of its domain playbook. The unified index — with per-agent affinity table — is at [docs/skills.md](../skills.md).

Rule of thumb:
- **Skill** = *how* to work (process). Sourced from the vendored Superpowers plugin.
- **Agent playbook** = *what* to work on (PDF-triage domain).

## When to spawn multiple agents in parallel

The user wants live UI + backend changes with no regressions. Common parallel patterns:

- Adding a REST endpoint that mutates a doc → `pipeline-engineer` + `ui-frontend` + `db-registry-keeper` in parallel, `qa-reviewer` after.
- Prompt refinement → `classification-expert` alone; then `qa-reviewer` for a rules audit.
- Schema change → `db-registry-keeper` first (blocks others), then `pipeline-engineer` + `classification-expert` + `ui-frontend` in parallel.

## Invocation etiquette

Every agent MUST:

1. Read its playbook (`docs/agents/<self>.md`) BEFORE touching code.
2. Read [Golden Rules](../knowledge/golden-rules.md).
3. Read every doc linked from its playbook's "Must-read" section.
4. Announce which files it plans to touch.
5. Never edit outside its ownership without pinging the owning agent first.
