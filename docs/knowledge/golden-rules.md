# 🛑 Golden Rules — Non-Negotiable

Every agent MUST obey. Violating any of these means the change is rejected.

Source of truth: `AGENT_REQUIREMENTS.md` and `AGENTS.md` at the project root. These docs summarize and cross-link.

## 0. Think First

Read the code, trace imports, verify schemas BEFORE editing. No guessing paths, parameters, or field names.

## 1. Scan scope

Scan **ONLY** inside `CONFIG.INPUT_DIR` (`__raws`). Never walk parents, siblings, or the whole disk. `__archive` is only read by Repair.

## 2. Server control

**NEVER** run `npm run dev` yourself. Always instruct the user to run/restart it in their own terminal.

## 3. No-text guard

If a PDF yields `< 10` clean characters, BLOCK it: no DB row, no move, keep it in `__raws`, emit `FILE_FAILED` SSE with the exact block message.

## 4. Strict no-subcategory fail guard

If AI resolves to an empty / `general` / `other` / `divers` / year-string subcategory, BLOCK the file. It stays in `__raws`, no DB row, no move. See [classification-flow](../workflows/classification-flow.md).

## 5. Pre-move dynamic auto-create

BEFORE moving a file, the missing category or subcategory MUST be inserted into `categories.json` (idempotent). Never construct folders for a slug that isn't in `categories.json` yet.

## 6. Deep semantic reading over keywords

The Ollama prompt and the fallback classifier MUST audit issuer, header, and legal purpose. Never classify off a lone keyword from a transaction row. Bank statements are the archetypal trap (`SFR` / `PayPal` appearing inside a Crédit Mutuel statement).

## 7. Company-level separation

Never lump. `banque` is invalid; use `credit_mutuel`, `societe_generale`, `bnp_paribas`, `boursobank`, `lcl`, `la_banque_postale`. Same rule for employers, insurers, health institutions, schools, vendors.

## 8. Canonical path shape

With subcategory: `__archive/<cat>/<sub…>/<YYYY>/<filename>.pdf`
Without: `__archive/<cat>/<YYYY>/<filename>.pdf`
Subcategory may be multi-level (`nextech/bachelor`).

## 9. Sequential non-blocking scan

Files are processed **one by one**. Yield to the event loop between files: `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, 50))`. Never `Promise.all` the pipeline.

## 10. Live SSE on every mutation

Every scan / relocalize / edit / repair / clear / auto-watcher tick / category change MUST broadcast an SSE event (`REGISTRY_UPDATED`, `FILE_COMPLETED`, `SCAN_COMPLETED`, `CATEGORIES_UPDATED`, etc.). See [sse-broadcast](../workflows/sse-broadcast.md).

## 11. Markdown representation

Every classified doc stores a `markdown_content` field — a clean structured Markdown reconstruction produced by Qwen 3.5. The UI renders it in the `📝 Document Markdown (.md)` box on the card.

## 12. Executive summary contract

3–5 searchable sentences capturing: issuing organization, key identifiers / ref #, financial amounts / dates, and core purpose. Written to `summary`, indexed in FTS5.

## 13. Toast notifications only

No `alert()`. Use the Toast service (`Toast.success/info/warning/error`).

## 14. Only Qwen 3.5

`CONFIG.OLLAMA_MODEL = 'qwen3.5:9b'`. Legacy models (`qwen2.5:7b`, `deepseek-r1:8b`) are purged; do not reintroduce.

## 15. Clear Registry semantics

`DELETE /api/documents` → move every physical file in `__archive` back to `__raws`, clean empty folders, purge SQLite. See [clear-registry](../workflows/clear-registry.md).

## 16. Repair Registry semantics

Fixes are strictly: ghost purge → re-classify generic subcategories → relocalize to canonical → move-back-to-raws if unrecoverable. Never delete a file — always move-back. See [repair-registry](../workflows/repair-registry.md).

## 17. Auto-watcher cadence

The web server ticks every 10 s; if `__raws` has PDFs and no scan is currently running, kick one off and broadcast progress. Guarded by an `isAutoScanning` flag.

## 18. Feedback-teaches-AI

When a user relocalizes via the modal with an explicit reason (`Why Category Wrong?` / `Why Subcategory Wrong?`), that reason is forwarded as `previousError` to `classifyPDFText` so Qwen retries with the correction. Do not silently swallow the reason.

## 19. Never invent field names

Zod schemas in `src/domain/document.schema.ts` are the contract. All AI JSON output MUST validate via `DocumentMetadataSchema`. Both `categorie` (French) and `subcategorie` are the canonical keys in the AI payload; DB columns are `category`/`subcategory` (English).

## 20. Determinism where it counts

- `temperature: 0.1` for Ollama classification.
- SHA-256 checksum is the dedupe key (`documents.checksum UNIQUE`).
- Year comes from doc date if present, else current year.
